# Hello

This is a redo of weareopal.digital's landing page [website](https://weareopal.digital), well it looks like it to some extent.
I really loved their use of colors and just about everything, so I felt the need to build a look-alike.
Well the layout is the same.
The slider carousel is made possible by the Swiper library (really modular) and the animations are a mix of Framer Motion and vanilla CSS.
