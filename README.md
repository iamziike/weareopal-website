# Hello

This is a redo of weareopal.digital landing page [website](https://weareopal.digital), well it looks like like it to some extent.

I really loved their use of colors and just about everything entirely so I felt the need to build a look-alike. Well the layout is the same.
Most of the functionality is handcrafted but the slider carousel is made possible by the Swiper library (really modular). and the animations are a mix of Framer Motion and vanilla CSS.
